# Final Spring 2020 June 6

# Create your full name to variable 'my_fullname'

# Create your student number to variable 'my_std_no'

# Honor Policy. For this exam, you must work alone. 
# You may not aid or accept aid from other students.

# You may also consult any other non-human resources you want

# Part 1: working with data frames 
# The followings are the R code with data frames. 
# You are to transform it into different R code with 
# Note that this repeats the analysis from Part 1, but should be
# performed using `dplyr`
# Hint : Refer exercise1.R and exercise2.R in the Chapter 11(dplyr).
#       And the keys have been already given.

# Use the `data()` function to load the "GNI2014" dataset
data("GNI2014")

# You should now have access to the `GNI2014` data frame
# You can use `View()` to inspect it
View(GNI2014)
nrow(GNI2014)

# Description of 'GNI2014'
# Gross national income (per capita) in dollars and 
# population totals per country in 2014.
# What is the GNI per capita?
# the dollar value of a country's final income in a year, 
# divided by its population.

# What is the GNI?
# Gross National Income (GNI) is a measurement of a country's income.


# Select the different continents (continents) of the countries in this data set.
# Save this vector in a variable
continents <- GNI2014$continent

head(continents)

# Use the `unique()` function to determine how many different continents
# are represented by the data set
length(unique(continents))

# (Problem1-1)
# Filter the data set for countries in Asia
GNI2014_Asia <- GNI2014[GNI2014$continent == "Asia", ]

#(Problem1-2) Arrange the Asia countries by GNI
GNI2014_Asia <- GNI2014_Asia[order(GNI2014_Asia$GNI), ]

# (Problem1-3)
# Mutate the GNI per capita data frame to add a column 'GNI_capita'.  
# The GNI per capita is the dollar value of a country's final income in a year, 
# divided by its population

GNI2014_Asia$GNI_capita <- GNI2014_Asia$GNI

GNI2014_Asia$GNI <- (GNI2014_Asia$population * GNI2014_Asia$GNI)

#(Problem1-4)
# Filter the whole GNI2014 data set for Europe that get more
# than 2000 in the GNI per capita.
# Save this new data frame in a variable.
GNI2014_Europ_2000 <- GNI2014[GNI2014$continent == "Europe" & GNI2014$GNI > 2000, ]


#(Problem1-5)
# Of the above GNI2014, what is the ios3 of the GNI2014 with the smallest
# population?
# Hint: filter for the smallest population, then select its iso3.
smallest_population <- GNI2014_Europ_2000$iso3[GNI2014_Europ_2000$population == min(GNI2014_Europ_2000$population)]


#(Problem1-5)
# Write a function that takes a `continent_choice` and a `pop_choice` as parameters,
# and returns the country that gets the most GNI
# with having more than 'pop_choice' in the population.
# You'll need to filter more (and do some selecting)!
continent_GNI_filter <- function(continent_choice, pop_choice) {
  filtered <- GNI2014[GNI2014$continent == continent_choice & GNI2014$population > pop_choice, ]
  filtered[filtered$GNI == max(filtered$GNI), "country"]
}

# What was the largest population of European country with having more than 200000 population?
continent_GNI_filter("Europe", 200000)


# Part 2 : Transform it into your code using the pipe operator

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# The data frame `flights` should now be accessible to you.
# Use functions to inspect it: how many rows and columns does it have?
# What are the names of the columns?
# Use `??flights` to search for documentation on the data set (for what the
# columns represent)
nrow(flights)
ncol(flights)
colnames(flights)

View(flights)
unique(flights$month)

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
# Save this as a data frame `greatest_dep_delay_by_month`

# you will first want to group the data by month.
# since you’re interested in the average departure delay, 
# you will want to summarize those groups to aggregate them.
# Because you can't take the mean() of NA values, you can do this by passing an na.rm=TRUE argument.
# You need to figure out the greatest average departure delay —
# which means you need to find the flights that were delayed (filtering for them).
# Finally, you can choose (select) the month of that group.
# You must use the pipe operator.

# Answer the following questions.
# 1. List the three main sections of an R Markdown.

cat("The three main sections are ")

# 'r your_R_code', a single backtick(')


#3. Sharing Reports as Websites
# 
# (1) Create the repo - 'Movie_Review' on your github.

# (3) Execute the 'index.Rmd' (RMarkdown file) by clicking the 'knit' button.
# (4) Push 'apikey.R', 'exercise.R', 'index.Rmd', 'index.html' into your repo - Movie_Review.
# (5) On the web portal page for your repo, click on the “Settings” tab, and scroll down to the section labeled “GitHub Pages.”
# (6) Select the “master branch” option to enable GitHub Pages. (See 18.4 Sharing Reports as Websites in the textbook)
